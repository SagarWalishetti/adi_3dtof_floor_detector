## Overview
The **ADI 3DToF Floor Detector** is a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for the Floor Detection application. The term "Floor Detection" refers to determining where the floor is in the given image. It is an image segmentation problem in which a given image is divided into floor and non-floor pixels. Floor Detection is an essential component of real-world applications such as Robot Navigation, Autonomous Driving, Augmented reality (AR) applications, and 'Obstacles Detection and Avoidance' for robots and people with inadequate vision.
Here is the sample output of **ADI 3DToF Floor Detector**. From the left, IR image & Depth image and Floor marked depth image can be seen below.


<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./docs/images/floor_detection.png" alt="Floor Detection Diagram"/></div>


The **ADI 3DToF Floor Detector** is developed as a ROS application running on the ADI’s *EVAL-ADTF3175D-NXZ* Time-of-Flight platform. The node uses [*ADI ToF SDK*](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ToF/) APIs to capture the frames from the sensor. The algorithm runs on the captured depth image and the outputs are published as ROS topics. The Floor Detection algorithm is highly optimized to run at the average of 60FPS on the *EVAL-ADTF3175D-NXZ* platform. The node publishes the Camera Info, Floor Mask Image of 512x512 (8bits per pixel) resolution along with Depth & IR Images of 512x512 (16 bits per image) resolution at 30FPS.

7. The ROS2 Humble and dependent packages are already installed in the EVAL-ADTF3175D-NXZ image and the source code for the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector* is present in `/home/analog/ros2_ws/src/` folder. The package is also pre-built, hence there is no need to build the package. The directory `/home/analog/ros2_ws/` is set up as the ros2 workspace and this workspace is already sourced in the `~/.bashrc`.
  
    > If the source files are modified, then use the following commands to build the package.
    > Copy the tof libraries from ~/Workspace/ToF/build/sdk/ to adi_3dtof_floor_detector/libs/ use the below command
    >```bash
    > $ cp ~/Workspace/ToF/build/sdk/libaditof.so* ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_floor_detector/libs/ 
    >```

    > Build the package using the below command.
    >>```bash
    >> $ cd ~/ros2_ws/
    >> $ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    >>```

    >  **:warning: <span style="color:red">If the above command is stuck in the console then execute below commands**</span> 
    >>```bash
    >> $ cd ~/ros2_ws/build/adi_3dtof_floor_detector 
    >> $ make -j1
    >>```
    > Once the build is successful, run the below commands so that symlinks are installed in the proper paths.
    >>```bash
    >> $ cd ~/ros2_ws/
    >> $ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    >> $ source install/setup.bash
    >>```

8.	Running the ROS Node:

    On the Device:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_floor_detector adi_3dtof_floor_detector_launch.py
    ```

    :memo: *Note:*  
    If you are using WSL as the Host machine, then you wont be able to list and subscribe to the topics published by the device. Please use a linux system to help visualize the topics.

    At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* will be launched and will start publishing the topics ```/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ir_image, /cam1/camera_info /cam1/floor_mask```.

    To see the depth, IR and floor mask images on the Host machine, simply open the RVIZ2 and add ```/cam1/depth_image``` and ```/cam1/ir_image```  and ```/cam1/floor_mask``` topics to visualize the images.

    The below image shows subscribed IR, Depth and Floor mask output images in RVIZ2.


    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="./docs/images/rviz_output_1.png" alt="RVIZ Output Diagram 1"/></div>


9.  To publish the compressed output images, change default value of *arg_enable_compression_op_image_topics* to "True" in the `launch/adi_3dtof_floor_detector_launch.py` file.
    
    Now run the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector* ROS node. At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector* node will be launched and will start publishing the topics like below.
    ```bash
    /cam1/camera_info
    /cam1/depth_image/compressedDepth
    /cam1/ir_image/compressedDepth
    /cam1/compressed_floor_mask
    ```
    You can observe the depth and IR image outputs in the RVIZ2 but you cannot directly see the ```compressed_floor_mask``` in the RVIZ2 from the Host machine as this topic is not compressed with RVL compression algorithm. You need to run the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* on the Host to machine to visualize it in RVIZ2.


<a id="build_on_host"> </a>
### Host Application

The package also provides a ROS node *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* which can be used to understand how to use the output from the ADI Floor Detector algorithm. The *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* subscribes to the output topics of *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* from the device and generates the output images. The output image topics of *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* can be either compressed or uncompressed.

:memo: *Note:* 
It is assumed that the correct version of ROS is installed and configured properly, if not please install the ROS from [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) and setup the ros2 workspace in the home directory with workspace folder named as "ros2_ws".

1. Clone the repo and checkout the correct release branch/tag into ros2 workspace/src directory
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/adi_3dtof_floor_detector.git -b v2.0.0
    ```

2. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/
    $ rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src    
    ```

3. Build the package
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws
    $ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DHOST_BUILD=TRUE 
    $ source install/setup.bash
    ```    

4. This node can be run in 2 ways using the following command in a new terminal. 
    
    :memo: *Note:* 
    Make sure that the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector* node is already running on a device before running this node.

    Using RVIZ2,  
    run the below command.   
    ```bash  
    $ros2 launch adi_3dtof_floor_detector adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_rviz_launch.py
    ```

    At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* will be launched and start publishing the output topics ```/host/floor_marked_depth_image, /host/floor_removed_depth_image```. The RVIZ2 will also be launched and outputs are shown as below.


    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="./docs/images/rviz_output_2.png" alt="RVIZ Output Diagram 2"/></div>

    Using RQT,  
    run the below command.
    ```bash
    $ros2 launch adi_3dtof_floor_detector adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_rqt_launch.py
    ```
    At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* will be launched and start publishing the output topics ```/host/floor_marked_depth_image, /host/floor_removed_depth_image```. The RQT will also be launched and outputs are shown as below.


    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="./docs/images/rqt_output.png" alt="RQT Output Diagram"/></div>


    Here, the displayed parameters can be changed in run-time. This will help in fine-tuning and evaluating the algorithm.

5. Optionally, you can enable floor removed point cloud output by changing the value of the parameter *arg_enable_pointcloud_output* to "True" in the adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_rviz_launch.py file.
    
    To visualize the point cloud output, add the ```/host/floor_removed_point_cloud``` in the RVIZ2. If the point cloud output is enabled when the outputs of the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* are not compressed then the process might slow down. For the best usage, recommended option is to enable compression on outputs of *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* when the point cloud output is required.

# Steps to run the ROS node on a Host machine in File-IO mode
The *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* and *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* can be run on a Host machine without the need for the actual 3D ToF sensor. This is mode is supported for users who would want to test the algorithm on the recorded video files. In this mode the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* will read the video file and publish the output ROS topics and *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* will subscribe to the outputs of *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* and will publish its output ROS topics. The *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* will also support uncompressed ROS topics as inputs but the user has to make sure that required input ROS topics are published, so that the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* subscribes to them and publishes output ROS topics.

Follow the instructions mentioned [here](#build_on_host) to clone and build the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* on the Host machine.

## Requirement on file-io input video files
To run the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* in file-io mode, the video files should be given as input.
Please follow the below instructions to set up the input video files.
1. Go to the installation directory of the *ADI 3DToF Floor Detector* appliation (~/Analog Devices/ADI3DToFFloorDetector-Relx.x.x)
2. Run the *get_video.sh* script which will download the *adi_3dtof_input_video_files.zip* file in the current directory.
3. Unzip it and copy the directory as *~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_input_video_files*.
4. Update the input file argument *arg_input_file_name_or_ros_topic_prefix_name* in the launch file *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node.launch* as per the above file path.

After the successful build, please refer the below instructions to run the node.

1. Change the following parameters in the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node_launch.py* file.

    With .bin file as input,
    ```
    arg_input_sensor_mode to be set to 2
    arg_in_file_name to be set to the input file name
    ```

2. After updating the launch file, run ros2 launch with the updated launch file.
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_floor_detector adi_3dtof_floor_detector_launch.py
    ```

At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_node* will be launched and will start publishing the topics ```/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ir_image, /cam1/camera_info /cam1/floor_mask```.

To see the depth, IR and Floor mask Images on the Host machine, simply open the RVIZ2 and add ```/cam1/depth_image``` and ```/cam1/ir_image```  and ```/cam1/floor_mask``` topics to visualize the images.

Run the *adi_3dtof_floor_detector_example_node* to get the ```/host/floor_marked_depth_image, /host/floor_removed_depth_image``` outputs.
